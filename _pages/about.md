<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am pursuing a Ph.D. in the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Nanyang Technological University. My research endeavors are based in the [Automated Driving and Human-Machine System (AutoMan) Lab](https://lvchen.wixsite.com/automan), which is led by Prof. Chen Lyu. 

My research center on the realm of autonomous driving and machine learning. The objective is to develop AI agents for predictive decisions-making in autonomous driving techniques. My research interest include deep learning and reinforcement learning for preediction, planning and decision-making.

[GameFormer: Game-theoretic Modeling and Learning of Transformer-based Interactive Prediction and Planning for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05760)

Zhiyu Huang*, Haochen Liu*, Chen Lv

**IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023**

[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05760) \| [**Project**](https://mczhi.github.io/GameFormer/) \| [![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/MCZhi/GameFormer?style=social&label=Code Stars)](https://github.com/MCZhi/GameFormer) \| **GameFormer Planner** [![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/MCZhi/GameFormer-Planner?style=social&label=Code Stars)](https://github.com/MCZhi/GameFormer-Planner) 

-  We address the interaction prediction problem by formulating it with hierarchical game theory and implementing it with TransFormer networks.
