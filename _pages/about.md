<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am pursuing a Ph.D. in the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Nanyang Technological University. My research endeavors are based in the [Automated Driving and Human-Machine System (AutoMan) Lab](https://lvchen.wixsite.com/automan), which is led by Prof. Chen Lyu. 

My research center on the realm of autonomous driving and machine learning. The objective is to develop AI agents for **predictive decisions-making** in autonomous driving techniques. My research interest include deep learning and reinforcement learning for prediction, planning, and decision-making framework modeling.
